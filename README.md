# lab
dotfiles, configs and much more for my machines


## Overview 

In trying to be more organized and repeatable about the machines in my homelab. This repo will track all major configration tweaks and desgin choices i will be making as the years go by. 


## Current setup 

Currently i run two machines: 

`Balrog` and `Lazarus`  each with a unuique and sometimes overlapping function, but they each get a folder as i intend to manage the configuration slightly differently. 



## How do i use this? 

Well its not quite ready yet so stay tuned if you care enough.
